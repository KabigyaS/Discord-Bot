# Discord-Bot
*** AI was used to for Learning Purposes and Assistants to create this bot. ***
This project is a Discord bot made with discord.py. It can respond to messages, run simple commands, and even chat using a local AI model called Ollama.
What it can do:
!ping: check if the bot is online
Chat responses: replies to greetings like "hello" or "how are you"
!ai: answers questions or prompts using Ollama AI
Welcome messages: says hi to new members when they join
Keeps your bot token safe using a .env file

It’s a fun and simple way to learn how to make a bot that talks, answers questions, and interacts with people on Discord..
